# RandomStuff

Collection of projects I have started to learn different programming topics.
My most advanced projects are my C++26 logger using reflected attributes [code](https://github.com/MaxOrtGit/RandomStuff/blob/main/cpp/cpp26/Cpp26reflection/WorkingAttributerWithPrint.cpp), a function that generates a map of functions templated to a list of classes [code](https://github.com/MaxOrtGit/RandomStuff/blob/main/cpp/cpp23/enum_class_mapping/ECMapping.cpp), and a custom std::formatter for tuples with parse options for rearranging and formatting individual items [code](https://github.com/MaxOrtGit/RandomStuff/blob/main/cpp/cpp23/print_tuple_formatter/stlprinttuple.cpp)
